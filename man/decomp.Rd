\title{Interface function for decompositions}
\usage{
decomp(x, y, k, i, o, v, method = c("leontief", "wwz"), verbose = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{intermediate demand table, it has dimensions GN x GN (G = no. of country, N = no. of industries),
excluding the first row and the first column which contains the country names,
and the second row and second column which contain the industry names for each country.
In addition, an extra row at the end should contain final demand.}

\item{y}{final demand table it has dimensions GN x MN,
excluding the first row and the first column which contains the country names,
the second column which contains the industry names for each country,
and second row which contains the five decomposed final demands (M).
#' @param k is a vector of country of region names}

\item{k}{vector or country or region names}

\item{i}{vector of sector or industry names}

\item{o}{vector of final outputs}

\item{v}{vector of value added, optional. If this vector is not specified, value added will be calculated as gross output - intermediate consumption}

\item{method}{user specified the decomposition method}

\item{verbose}{logical, should timings of the calculation be displayed? Default is FALSE}

\item{...}{arguments to pass on the respective decomposition method}
}
\value{
The output when using the WWZ algorithm is a matrix with dimensions GNG*19.
 Whereby 19 is the 16 objects the WWZ algorithm decomposes exports into, plus three checksums.
 GNG represents source country, using industry and using country.
}
\description{
This function runs the decomposition.
NOTE: the default method is now "leontief", please specify method="wwz" explicitly for Wang-Wei-Zhu.
See http://qua.st/decompr/decompr-v2/ for more information.
}
\details{
Version 2 introduces several important changes, the default method is now leontief, which means that wwz has to be specified explicitly.
Furthermore, the input object have a different structure, see the information below for details.
